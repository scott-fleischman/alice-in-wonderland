## Output of Analysis
See the [output files](output/README.md) for basic textual analysis.

## Twitter Bot
See the Twitter bot in action at [@PoorLittleAlice](https://www.twitter.com/poorlittlealice).

It tweets one sentence every half-hour. Sentences longer than 280 characters are broken into multiple tweets which are posted in a single thread. Poetry and other significant indentation is preserved when tweeting.

See the code [here](twitter/README.md).
